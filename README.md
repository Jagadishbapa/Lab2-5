Ryan Durnan Lab2 Submission

The code for this lab creates Linear Linked List objects.
I was responsible for writing three functions:
  1) A size function that reports how many values are in
      the list.
  2) A sum function that adds all the values in the list
      together.
  3) A function that inserts a value at the end of the list.

Jagadish (TA) helped me understand how the original code worked
by explaining the Node structure. This allowed me to figure out
the first two functions.

Jeremiah Vaskis explained how to approach the third function.
